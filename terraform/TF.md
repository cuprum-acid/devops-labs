# Terraform

## Best Practicies

* Use `.gitignore` in order not to push sensitive data from `terraform.tfstate` file (It is better to keep it in your S3 bucket).

* Use `terraform fmt` and `terraform validate` to format and check correctness of your code.

* It is better to review changes with `terraform plan` first before agree on `terraform apply`

* Use `variables.tf` in order not to hardcode variables and mark sensitive with flag `sensitive = true`

* Specify exact versions in `terraform required_providers`

* Define variables in `.tfvars` or environment variables, but do not push them in repo

## Docker Infrastructure Using Terraform

### `terraform state list` command output

```bash
ebob@laptop docker_terraform % terraform state list

docker_container.app_python_container
docker_container.app_ruby_container
```

### `terraform state show <resource_address>` command output

```bash
ebob@laptop docker_terraform % terraform state show docker_container.app_python_container

## Yandex Cloud Using Terraform

### Getting started

First of all, read [official guide from Yandex Cloud about Terraform](https://yandex.cloud/en-ru/docs/tutorials/infrastructure-management/terraform-quickstart). Then, visit [Yandex Cloud Provider on Terraform Registry](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/yandex-cloud/yandex/latest/docs). After that, we can start by creating service account and getting [IAM token](https://yandex.cloud/en-ru/docs/iam/operations/iam-token/create-for-sa).

### `terraform plan`

```bash
ebob@laptop yandex_cloud_terraform % terraform plan
var.cloud_id
  Yandex Cloud ID

  Enter a value:

var.folder_id
  Yandex Folder ID

  Enter a value:

## GitHub Terraform

### Import with `terraform import`

```bash
ebob@laptop github_terraform % terraform import "github_repository.repo" "devops-labs"
var.github_token
  GitHub personal access token

  Enter a value:

github_repository.repo: Importing from ID "devops-labs"...
github_repository.repo: Import prepared!
  Prepared github_repository for import
github_repository.repo: Refreshing state... [id=devops-labs]

Import successful!

The resources that were imported are shown above. These resources are now in
your Terraform state and will henceforth be managed by Terraform.
```

### Apply changes

```bash
ebob@laptop github_terraform % terraform apply
var.github_token
  GitHub personal access token

  Enter a value:

github_repository.repo: Refreshing state... [id=devops-labs]

Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create
  ~ update in-place

Terraform will perform the following actions:
